# NewView
Do you find yourself selecting YouTube videos based on view count? "This one only has 40 views? Can't be very good then." This mindset hinders the discovery of interesting new content.

Introducing NewView, a Chrome extension that automatically randomizes all YouTube views and like counts. No longer will you be a slave to popular opinion. Each video on the page is assigned a random view count between 100 million and 1 billion. Freely click on the videos you think are interesting without having to compare and contrast popularity.
