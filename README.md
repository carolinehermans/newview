# NewView
Are you a slave to view counts? Do you find yourself silently judging other people's videos just because of how many views they have? "2 million views, better watch this one", you may think to yourself. "This one only has 40 views? Can't be very good then." How can we discover new and interesting content when we operate with this bias?

Introducing NewView, a Chrome extension that automatically randomizes all YouTube views and like counts. No longer will you be a slave to popular opinion. Each video on the page is assigned a random view count between 100 million and 1 billion – every video is a winner! You can freely can click on the videos you think are interesting without comparing and contrasting view counts.
